The MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture is a design pattern for building user interfaces (UIs) that helps manage the flow of data in applications, particularly in a way that ensures predictability and simplicity. It is commonly used in modern Android development, but it can be applied to other platforms as well.

MVI is based on a unidirectional data flow, which makes it easier to track state changes in the UI. It emphasizes the use of immutable states, where the UI reflects a single state at any point in time.

Core Components of MVI Architecture:
  Model:
    Represents the state of the application or a specific part of the application.
    The state is immutable, meaning it does not change directly; instead, every time something changes, a new state is created.
    The model holds the business logic and data that your app works with.
  View:
    Responsible for rendering the state of the application on the screen.
    The view observes the state and displays the UI accordingly.
    It listens to state changes and updates the UI based on the current state.
    It should not contain any logic but should focus purely on presenting the data it receives.
  
  Intent:
    Represents user actions or events triggered from the UI (such as button clicks, screen loads, etc.).
    Intents are used to describe the interaction between the user and the view.
    These intents are processed to change the state of the application.
